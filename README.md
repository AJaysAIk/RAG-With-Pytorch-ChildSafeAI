RAGify-PyTorch: Scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation with PyTorch
Welcome to RAGify-PyTorch, a project that demonstrates how to efficiently implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using PyTorch and other cutting-edge techniques to tackle large-scale natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This repository showcases an end-to-end workflow for content moderation and relevance detection, all while ensuring computational efficiency and accuracy.

üöÄ Project Overview
In this project, we address a real-world challenge: evaluating the appropriateness of user-generated content (e.g., songs or text) for children on a social media platform. Given the high cost of processing millions of items using large language models (LLMs), we propose an efficient solution using RAG. By combining retrieval models with generation models, this approach provides a scalable alternative to full LLM processing.

üìù Key Features
Embedding Generation: Use pre-trained models to generate dense embeddings for effective data representation.
RAG Workflow: Implement a pipeline combining retriever and generator models for relevance-based content evaluation.
Cosine Similarity: Enhance relevance detection by replacing dot product with cosine similarity.
t-SNE Visualization: Visualize high-dimensional data for better understanding of data distribution and clustering.
Fine-Tuning: Customize pre-trained language models for specific tasks to improve accuracy on targeted datasets.
Performance Evaluation: Compare retrieval methods (cosine similarity vs. dot product) to assess efficiency and relevance.
